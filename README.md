# Bank tech test

A practice tech test for week 10 of Makers Academy. The program provides a bank account that users can deposit into and withdraw from. A user can then see a statement with a history of their transfers.

## Setup

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run tests:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ev-th/bank-tech-test.git
cd bank-tech-test
bundle install
rspec
```

## Usage

You can interact with with program in IRB
```ruby
# Require the files.
require_relative 'lib/bank_account'
require_relative 'lib/statement_printer'

# Initialize a new BankAccount object.
account = BankAccount.new

# Make a deposit.
account.deposit(1000)

# Make a withdrawal.
account.withdraw(500)

# Use a StatementPrinter object to print a statement for the account.
printer = StatementPrinter.new
printer.print_statement(account)
```

## Approach
### Plan
It made sense to me to have a BankAccount class that would hold some state about transfers and have functionality for withdrawals, deposits and statement printing. I considered making a class for transfers, but decided that since the program is very simple and I couldn't think of any functionality they need. I decided to stick to a hash for now.

### Writing the code
I approached this program test first, ensuring to implement all the requirements, no more or less. I started by writing the simplest feature test for returning a printable statement before deposits or withdrawals were made, then followed red/green/refactor steps. I ensured the tests passed in the simplest way I could, and didn't refactor the code until required to by further tests. I then made tests for a single deposit, a single withdrawal, and finally for a combination of both. With each new test, I implemented the code to pass it before moving on to the next test.

### Refactor
At this point everything was inside one class, which had multiple responsibilities.
It made sense to refactor the transfer hashes into their own Transfer class, which could hold the amount and the timestamp. This way I could also give them a method to check whether it was a deposit or withdrawal.
The BankAccount class was also handling formatting for printing on top of transfer logic. Therefore, I extracted printing into a StatementPrinter class with a print_statement method that takes the account as an argument.
This process of refactoring brought up a new problem: StatementPrinter was now using the Transfer objects directly, when ideally it should only be using the Account API. Therefore, I extracted some of the formatting logic into the TransferFormatter class, which is passed to StatementPrinter at construction. This new class's responsibility is to format Transfer objects into an array of strings that can be easily manipulated by StatementPrinter.

The following is copied from the README of the original tech test specifications:

# Requirements 

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time.  This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or Node.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2023  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2023  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2023  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
